# Week 8

I did it. I archived Notes and merged it with the markdown notes. I am moving my daily notes to this one long markdown file.

The main reason is that I can easily inject this as my personal context when I talk to LLMs. It's a hassle when notes are scattered across the UI snippets and tiny markdown files. 

Each file will be annual. Daily file is too tiny. Weekly might be cool. But still, 50 and more files a year takes some listing logics. I don't want to use a collection. I can manually handle files if I keep it yearly. The priority is keeping the context in few files, not weekly project management. I can do that in Notion.
