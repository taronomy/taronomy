# Week 8

I did it. I archived Notes and merged it with the markdown notes. I am moving my daily notes to this one long markdown file.

The main reason is that I can easily inject this as my personal context when I talk to LLMs. It's a hassle when notes are scattered across the UI snippets and tiny markdown files. 

Each file will be annual. Daily file is too tiny. Weekly might be cool. But still, 50 and more files a year takes some listing logics. I don't want to use a collection. I can manually handle files as long as I keep it yearly. 

The point is keeping the context in few files, not weekly project management. I can do that in Notion. This is where I just spill out and later ask machines to take a look. It's for _articifial consciousness_.

## Last hour 

This is u56w08g2300.

I've migrated most of my old notes into the annual logs. I wanted to do this when I was back to Seoul. But I could not. This is the time. I feel it.

u50 and u51 still needs translation. And u50 needs to elaborate on project platform and ruminate the insights I had the second half of the year.
