# Society of One

> _You can't step into the same river twice._ — Heraclitus

All things flow. Society is a constant stream, never permanent. Someone wrote the rules we play by. Now it’s our turn to rewrite them. ‘Society’ might come off as an insurmountable monolith. Certainly its ossified structures can trap you in vicious cycles. In the downward spiral, people often put the blame on themselves. 

- (it’s not you, it’s broken systems and us not knowing how to fix it)
- (there’s a hope)

I call it *Society of One* to claim three objectives. First, society is what each *one* of us radiates as its constituent. Representative democracies are preliminaries. Second, society can be, and should be, organised into manageable *units* in space and time. “Projects” are modular social systems for it. Third, *unification* of society doesn’t come from a single perfect social system. Conversely, it comes from pluralising and differentiating into diverse social systems we can experiment, iterate, and archive. 

It the following chapters, we are going to discuss what it means in detail.

## Society as Living Systems

## Projects as Temporal Society

## Autonomy as Social Capital
