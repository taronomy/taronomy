# Inner Communication

I've finished Inner Communication. I need to understand the idea of communication in the book in the context of social philosophy. Communication itself is certainly internal. Successful communication 'internalises' the communicators. And forms a recognition. A society. All is soft inside.

I thought of the drawing she made me do. In the image, I was reaching for an apple located in a distant island. My arm lengthened like rubber. "How vain I am?" I thought. Nietzsche spake untergang. I've learnt somatic nature of my mind. Body is holy. I am the incarnation of the human future.

- Meditation is forgiving, putting it all down, a surrender, a release.
- Meditation is being here and now.
- Meditation is breathing.
- Meditation is letting it flow.

I surely have fixation in my memory-ego. I wouldn't let time go. And I don't feel them properly. There was also a clue with ADD.

- Meditation is losing all distinction between good and bad.
- Meditation is movement.
- Meditation is the gap between new information and old one.
- Meditation is the space between the stimulus and my response.
- Meditation is changing.

## Preface

- Training mind can improve your
  - mental health
  - improve physical health
  - performance

- Meditation is the most efficient mind training.
- Meditation is inner communication.
- Meditation is not about religion or mysticism.
- Meditation is a daily activity for your mind.

- The opposite of democracy is violence.
- Mind-training is a rather political, communitarian offer.

## 1. Why mental muscles

### Brain adds bias to the world we see for survival.
{:.no_toc}

- Some of the biases are not suitable for modern society.
- We can change these biases.
- Our brain is still living stone ages.
- Brain prioritises survival over accuracy.
- Human perception has evolved to maximise our survival and proliferation.
- Core function of our brain is to create bias.
- Point of intelligence is to create bias.
- Creating bias means creating meaning.
- Storytelling is to put meaning in a language.
- Heart of consciousness is storytelling.

### Modern people with ancient brains
{:.no_toc}

- Under a stress, human body redirects energy to muscles in expense of
  - digestive system
  - immune system
- Upon a danger, we rely on amygdala neural network over mPFC network.
- Unresolved fear turns into anger and aggression.
- Modern survival has little to do with muscles.
- Brain doesn't know that muscles don't resolve emergencies.
- Stabilise Amygdala first in order to activate mPFC.
- Amygdala is the centre of our limbic system, the backbone of our emotion.
- Amygdala is the core of 'fear circuit'.
- 'Fear learning' makes us react harder for a similar stimulus.
- Amygdala-impaired individual shows all reactions but fear.

### Zebras don't get a sore stomach
{:.no_toc}

- Cortisol, the stress hormone, increases the blood supply to the muscles.
- Prolonged stress causes trouble in digestive, reproductive, immune systems.
- Many "bears" continuously activate the brains of modern society.
- If you have family problems, you are effectively keeping a bear in house.
- Stress hormones are in the pills for autoimmune diseases.
- Stress hormones are that powerful controlling the immune system.
- Sore amygdala hurts your body and suppress mPFC.

### Amygdala and mPFC on a see-saw
{:.no_toc}

- Thinking can wait when a fast reaction promises survival.
- Chronic stress equals sore amygdala.
- Intentionally stabilise amygdala and activate mPFC to maximise your capabilities.
- 'Functional connectivity' between mPFC and amygdala controls emotion.
- mPFC-amygdala shows positive correlation under 10, but negative after that.
- mPFC, amygdala and most of other brain functions are oversimplifications.
- Amygdala itself doesn't equal to negative emotions.

### Importance of education for mind training
{:.no_toc}

- Development of mPFC finishes at around 25.
- Stabilising amygdala is the most efficient against violence among the young.
- Mitigation of chronic stress minimises the habit of negative emotion.
- Sore amygdala is highly contagious.
- Sore parents make kids sore.
- Happiness of parents raises happy, capable children.
- SEL, or Social and Emotional Learning helps sociability and achievement.
- "social" in Korean is way too often translated to "societal".
- There are two types of abilities: cognitive skills and non-cognitive ones.
- Regular curricula misses non-cognitive skills such as
  - perseverance
  - focus
  - resilience
- We are all victims of cognitive skill centric education.
- No one seems to care the capability of making an actual difference.
- **Mind-training means one can change one's own environment.**
- Future education must teach that self-transformation changes the world.
- AI will transcend human cognitive skills anyway.

> Sincere academics betray their disciples with over-specialisation.

## 2. Neurological foundation of three mental muscles

### Three categories of human existence
{:.no_toc}

- Three categories are the basic frame of human existence.
- Firstness is 'I', the abstract and theology.
  - It's communication with oneself: Self-control.
- Secondness is 'thou', the mind and psychology.
  - It's communication with others: Interpersonal relationship.
- Thirdness is 'it', the matter and cosmology.
  - It's communication with the world: Self-motivation.
- Self-control is the foundation of the rest two.

### Communication is mind training
{:.no_toc}

- The essence of human existence is communication with others

### Self-control: 'I'
{:.no_toc}

- "I" is multiple.
- Self is the objective "me".
- In Kahneman terms, experiencing self controls remembering self.
- Or, 'I' controls 'self'.
- Your mind carefully selects your experience and creates a meaningful story to remember.
- It's difficult for 'I' to perceive 'self' without other people or occupation.
- 'self' is created by the people and the world.
- In other words, all things are connected by 'self'.
- Self-control is more than suppression.
- Focusing attention and energy is a part of self-control.
- Self-focus means being aware of current status of self.
- Self-referential processing is crucial to mind training and meditation.
- Control is to take a step back and reappraise by being aware and see objectively.
- Food junkies' vmPFC only responds to the taste and not to the nutritional info.
- Similar to muscles, self-control gets
  - fatigued from short-term usage
  - stronger from long-term usage

### Relationship: 'others'
{:.no_toc}

- Interpersonal relationship means to
  - express your intentions
  - understand others' intention
  - have leadership
- Refusal and bullying activates the same spot for physical pain.
- 'I' does not start until 3 and Theory of Mind develops.
- Process of positive info about I and other shares a network around mPFC.
- **It means process of positive info is a powerful tool for mind training.**
- Gut-feelings detect potential threats first.

### Self-motivation: 'world'
{:.no_toc}

- Self-motivation means to design something and to bring it into reality.
- Autonomy means to believe that 'I' can change the world I'm living in.
- High self-motivation shows higher Default Mode Network activity.

### Brain science of mind training
{:.no_toc}

- Negative emotion and sore amygdala weakens the network around mPFC.
- MRI utilises resonance of magnetic field on hydrogen.
- Activation of a part of the brain does not correspond to a function 1-by-1.
- Weakened mPFC requires more activation for mind training.

## 3. Training mental muscles

### The illusion of genetic determinism
{:.no_toc}

- The result of mental training depends on the attitude of the trainee.
- Some limit themselves that they can change only so much.
- Parents are more of an environment than a source of genes.
- Geniuses is not more successful than others.
- There is no correlation between IQ and achievement.
- Epigenetics is the study of the interaction between genes and their environment.
- Parents should contemplate "What kind of environment am I to my kids".
- Some "inheritances" are a result of recurring environment throughout generations.
- Anxiety disorder can be inherited by the pregnancy, not the genes.
- Caress of parent mouse affects the development of the brains of their children.
- It's been proven that behaviour affects the expression of genotypes more than genes.
- Genes and domestic environment results in a synergy that affects a person.

### Mind on epigenetics
{:.no_toc}

- Genes conditions the impact of environment, vice versa.
- Mostly, genes and environment interact to create an impact.
- Body compensates its genetics, often resulting in unexpected results.
- Environment can amplify genotypes.
- Environment is more important because it's much easier to change.
- Better domestic environment can create a better society.
- Mind training is changing the environment of our experience.

### Neuroplasticity
{:.no_toc}

- Neural network can be altered by repeated stimulation
- Hebbian principle: Neurons that fire together, wire together.
- Neural network remains malleable your entire life.
- Habitual negative emotions divide pros and amateurs.
- Weak minds easily get frustrated, resentful and afraid.
- Established habit of mind does not change for an epiphany.
- Just like muscles, mind training takes persistence.
- **Mind training means changing the habits of mind.**
- Mind training is not about technique or knowledge.
- Mind changes anyway, but mind training means to change it with an intention.
- Note: Resolution alone does not make your mind any stronger.
- Some stress or frustration may signify you are changing fast.
- If mind training gives you a frustration, appreciate it and keep going on.
- **It's important to manage the state of mind before you sleep.**
- Alcohol is an anti-mPFC matter.
- Alcohol does not help you relax.
- Was it a rough day? What you need is warm tea and a walk under the sun.

## 4. Changing oneself

### What makes changing self possible
{:.no_toc}

- Mind training means to change oneself.
- Human being is capable of changing themselves.
- Self is a structure of many components, not a single thing.
- Self is a living organism that consists of a constant interaction of many entities.
- Scholars agree that self is a constant storytelling.
- Thoughts and consciousness themselves are communication already.
- Storytelling or meaning completes itself by being shared with others.
- Self is a result of one's own communication.
- Objective reality is only an assumption that arises from an intersubjective experience.
- Mead: Objective self is the self as a generalised other.
- 'I' can change 'self'.
- Self is a community of minds competing with one another.
- Inner communication implies talking 'me' and listening 'me'.
- Self is an image.
- Jason is brain-dead only when he takes a visual information.
- 'Consciousness' is a selective integration process of infra-systems.

### Consciousness and inner communication
{:.no_toc}

- You can not directly intend your heartbeat.
- Self often identifies with intention and execution.
- But there is the observing self: consciousness itself.
- We are aware of consciousness but cannot describe it.
- Consciousness cannot be an object of our observation. It's the observer.
- "Here and now" means the awareness of consciousness.
- Consciousness let us take a step back and observe the habit of our storytelling.
- That's how we can work on storytelling instead of being carried away by it.
- Change starts from being aware of consciousness AND experience.
- Once we realise that our experience is ephemeral, we access equanimity.
- Consciousness may incarnate as a voice or a gaze.
- The object of change is the inertia. The subject is the intention.
- Self is a ball of stories, an accumulation of episodic memories.
- We edit our experience with communication, not the other way around.
- We only remember experiences that translates to stories.
- Reality unfolds as we tell ourselves.
- Self-affirmation is communication of our core values.
- Writing short essays of core values increases actual achievement.
- When you plan on a revenge, it makes you an enemy of your enemies.

### Consciousness as a constant communication
{:.no_toc}

- Brain scientists believe that storytelling is the essence of consciousness.
- Julian Jaynes says that consciousness has developed between left and right brains.
- **According to Jaynes, use of language has resulted in consciousness.**
- Modern society has lost true colloquialism.
- Speech is an emulation of writing.
- Rupture of bicameral minds left the right brain a mute prisoner.
- Characters in Iliad listen to the voices for decision-making.
- According to Jaynes, "analogue I" observes "bodily I" who make actions.
- Recent findings in science implies that time and space are created by biological conditions.
- It's storytelling that creates space and time, not the other way around.

### Consciousness on quantum physics
{:.no_toc}

- It's known that human observation interferes physical matters.
- Stapp claims that quantum mechanics are essential to the operation of mind.
- Kafatos claims that human consciousness is one connected cosmic consciousness.
- Kafatos' cosmology aligns with Active Inference of Friston and Implicate Order of Bohm.
- Wigner's cat divides the universe by a shared status of mind.
- Some say there's only one shared status and all consciousness are affected.
- Bohm is the most prominent theoretical physicist in 'connectivity' and 'integrity'.
- Consciousness can be multiple and observe one another.
- A triangle is made of lateral edges.
- Once we are aware of a consciousness, we know we need another one that observes it.
- Consciousness is not a blank slate. It's full of 'internal model'.
- Consciousness is a prediction machine, rather than a clear glass you can see through.

### Images in the brain
{:.no_toc}

1. uniqueness
2. synchronicity
3. continuity
4. soma
5. passivity

- We take "I-ness" granted. But it's a fiction created by our brains.
- Consciousness creates the sense of one, integral 'I'.
- Consciousness relates separate senses to create a whole experience.
- Baars says a "Global Workspace" is the essence of consciousness.
- Dehaene says 'conscious access' creates 'something reportable to others.'
- Consciousness translates personal experience into a shareable communication.
- Consciousness is necessary to minimise the prediction error in our brains.
- Communication let us share inner model across individual minds.
- It seems that this 'storyteller' lives in our left brain.
- Brain is not a passive watcher. It's an active editor.
- Space is perceived in relation to the movement of one's body.
- Our brain manages many different senses of time.
- Flow of time is a creation of our consciousness.
- Universal God must be moving at the speed of light.
- Image of body is an illusion.
- 'Somatic body' is the perception of one's own body.
- Active inference does not emerge to consciousness.
- Brain actively predicts what will come next.
- Prediction yields efficiency.
- Our brain creates inner model and project it to the world.
- Having an inner model is much more efficient than processing everything everytime.
- Thalamus is the gateway to consciousness.
- **Nerves are 10x thicker between occipital lobe and thalamus than between eye and thalamus.**
- We see more with brains than eyes.
- Listening also involves more 'inner voice'.
- Minimising prediction error is minimising free energy.
- Inner communication takes place between self and 'I'.
- Self creates experiences, and consciousness notices experiences.

## 5. How brain works

### Inference: what brain does
{:.no_toc}

- Brain makes "inference".
- Brain integrates **"percepts"** to create a meaningful storytelling.
- Meaningful means that it's useful for survival.
- Such integration is an old problem of brain. And consciousness is the solution.
- Accessing the raw percepts before storytelling can be a good conscious exercise.
  - A-C-B can be C-A and C-B. Consciousness can access percepts without mediation.
- Open awareness is a powerful self-referential process.
- Inference creates mental model in the brain.
- Inference itself is subconscious.

### Abduction: the logics behind the inference
{:.no_toc}

1. generalised pattern: Typing gives your sleeve a shine.
2. specific observation: One has a shiny sleeve.
3. inferred guess: The one is (probably) a typist.

- Peirce calls hypothetical inference "abduction".
- Abduction makes an 'active' guess by mixing old and new information.
- Deduction is always accurate. But it does not create any information.
- Induction generalises the world to create patterns that can be invalidated.
- Abduction applies patterns to the real world risking many fallacies.
- Abduction is the most inaccurate, risky, yet productive argument.
- Kepler guessed that the orbits must be elliptical. It was an abduction.
- We make abduction everyday.
- Abduction is the only possible way for us to be rational in our daily lives.
- Peirce says we all have innate ability to make abduction.
- All misunderstanding stems from different premises behind our abductions.
- **It's critical for mental fitness to work on these premises.**
- Premises exist as generative models in our minds.
- Helmholz made the suggestion of automatic inference 150 years earlier than Peirce.
- According to Helmholz, visual perception follows its own subconscious processes.
- Helmholz thought automatic inference proves that perception is subconscious.
- Peirce clarified that such process is abduction, not deduction.
- According to Peirce, all memories and sense of history are products of abduction.
- It implies that even our immediate perception is a top-down process of the generative model.
- Helmholz machine describes perception as a statistical inference engine.

### Prediction error and free energy principle
{:.no_toc}

- Free energy principle is a major achievement of Friston.
- It says brain is a Helmholz machine that makes active inference and predictive regulation.
- It describes brain as a complex, hierarchical network of top-down and bottom-up processes.
- For example, vision is based on the prediction error from internal visual model.
- Our brain tends to minimise such error and create an 'accurate' image of the world.
- **Life is defined by the boundary between in and out. The gap is the prediction error.**
- At the centre of the feedback cycles, self-consciousness emerges.
- The goal of active inference is to minimise the surprise, or prediction error.
- Active inference means to minimise surprise with movement, perception, and interpretation.

> The term "active" in "active inference" reflects the idea that organisms and agents are not passive recipients of sensory information, but instead actively engage with their environment by generating actions that help them gather relevant information and shape their sensory experiences.

- In a way, consciousness is the inference of our actions and the future it occurs.
- In short, life try to minimise surprise. And its internal system grows into an agent.
- Such agent inevitably creates a cyclical storytelling, or self-evidencing.
- In our consciousness, minimising surprise emerges as storytelling.
- The essence of consciousness is a constant storytelling. And it's the inner communication.

### Markov blanket
{:.no_toc}

- Free energy principle is not just for brains. It can describe organisations and other systems.
- Markov blanket means the inner state tries to minimise free energy around the boundary.
- A Markov chain connects two sequential probabilistic events.
- A Markov blanket is a node that separates itself from all the other nodes.
- A Markov blanket means no additional information from outside will be meaningful.
- In terms of time, Markov blanket is the 'present' that predicts the future by the past.
- external-perception-internal-action-external process creates a "strange loop".
- To perceive something is to perceive self. Because perception is also a projection of action.
- Consciousness creates intention and stories but does not engage all the thoughts one by one.

### Markov blanket and inner communication
{:.no_toc}

- Storytelling is necessary because talking to others can minimise surprise a lot.
- That's why consciousness exists and it constantly make percepts reportable.
- If you have significantly different inner state than others', you are deemed delusional.
- Talking to others means Markov blankets are touching each other's boundaries.
- That's why communication is done with the body, not just mind.
- Higher level of nervous system control the lower levels to down regulate surprises.
- Friston says "I exist. Therefore I think."
- Mental fitness makes you turn around and see inside of your boundary.
- Phasic alertness comes from outside like a siren.
- Tonic alertness comes from inside. It maintains the identical state of being awake for a long time.
- Ego is an image created by the brain.
- It's more of a process, the contents of transient ego model.
- Why do we need such a self-consciousness? The answer is movement.
- The essence of self is an inner state that is aware of senses and actions.
- Traditional meditations all focus on inner state.
- Tai chi emphasises chi.
- Mental fitness goes for less surprises incurred by wrong predictions.

### New understanding of mental disorders and reward systems
{:.no_toc}

- Old psychology uses the sandwich model: sense-perception-action.
- Disability of inference is the new culprit of mental disorders.
- It means that there's an imbalance between premises and new information.
- Anxiety, depression, even autism and schizophrenia are caused by interference of inference.
- Dreams are unreal because the brain is not taking any new information to adjust premises.
- It's the same when we close our eyes and meditate.
- Even if you see something when you meditate, such experience is not very meditative.
- Folie a deux demonstrates how different storytelling affects others'.
- We get much more genes from mothers. (mitochodrial genes)
- Human sense is built for survival and not effective for the scientific truths.
- Human brain is a sophisticated delusional system for survival.
- Shared delusion is considered the truth.
- Delusion always comes as truth. You need to know all truth is delusion.

> Fear prophets, Adso, and those prepared to die for the truth, for as a rule they make many others die with them, often before them, at times instead of them. ― Umberto Eco, The Name of the Rose

- It's been revealed that 'reward' and 'compensation' are overrated.
- Friston says dopamine hits when the experience is significant, not necessarily rewarding.
- Predictable rewards do not fire dopamine hits.
- Dopamine system only works on the gap of expectation and surprises.
- If something fires a dopamine hit, it means the prediction was accurate.
  - It doesn't seem right.
- To change behaviour, give new environment or stimulus.
- Unpredictable stimulus is much more stronger than reward/punishment.
- **Mindfulness means to take everything as if it's new.**
- Mindful meditation let you take everything new so you will get constant flow of dopamine.
- Technology is more of an extended sense state, rather than an object of it.
- Media are a part of our active inference process.
- Markov blankets can be overlapped.
- Each sections of brain also makes Markov blankets.
- They create network and organisations and societies.
- Not just the structure, but the process of inference is overlapped.
- Inner communication is an interaction among different level of Markov blankets.
- We cannot arbitrate lower level of our mind. But our higher mind can influence them.
- Focusing on sense can activate the broad cortex and soothe amygdala.
- Second step of sense training is to see what emotion senses incur.
- There's always a gap between intention and movement.
- Inner communication training is creating intention training.
- Consciousness simply notices experience. Noticing consciousness is the best self-reference.
- Another way is to notice the habits of storytelling, and to intentionally change them.
- Consciousness lives at the top of the generative model.
- It's important to be positive storytelling about yourself and others.
- Step back from "action mode" and engage "existence mode" to remove all anger and anxiety.

## 6. Intrinsic order and inner communication

### Quit the mechanical world
{:.no_toc}

- implicate order, enfolding
- Unfolding is the default worldview on the mechanical world.
- Analytical mind says the parts are the reality and the whole is a mental construct.
- According to Bohm, reality is the 'universe as a whole' and the parts are made up by human.
- Human mind is built to create and receive fictions, not the truth.
- Newtonian science suppose that you can know the whole by the parts and their interaction.
- Bohm says an organic, process-oriented thoughts can be more helpful.
- Implicate order makes sense in 'events' and 'processes', as opposed to 'particles' or 'reality'.
- Voxel is an arbitrary separation made by human mind.
- We might think voxels are the "reality".
- Animate world has been decimated after Descartes.
- Violence and sacrifice are justified for the "spirit" is the reality and the bodies are not.
- But any ideology and society must serve the human body, not the opposite.
- There's nothing to gain in sacrifice of human body.
- Inner communication theory moves away from this body-mind duality.

### Universe as a whole and implicate order
{:.no_toc}

- discontinuity: Electrons "jumps" to change orbits with no intermediate state.
- indeterminacy: Particles are placed on superposition and react to their environments.
- According to Bohm, universe is one from the first place.
- Parts can be only understood after the whole.
- Consciousness and experience are not strictly divided.

### Organic world and the wholistic movement
{:.no_toc}

- Bohm: enfoldment + unfoldment = holomovement
- Stabilised flow comes as a solid object, like a vortex.
- Consciousness is an implicate order for your thought and emotions.
- Soma-significant means that the body and mind are two sides of one reality.
- soma-significance: bottom-up
- signa-somatic: top-down
- Energy and matter creates the space and time, not the other way around.
- Matter is condensed energy.
- Bohm speculates that matter, energy, and significance makes a triangle.
- Ego constantly resist the environment to separate itself from the outside.
- It may be stuck on the past and project it to the future.
- Experiencing self makes Csikszentmihalyi's "flow".
- Consciousness is pure energy.
- The goal of inner communication is to understand the ego, not eradicating it.
- We fall into pain when we identify with our ego.

### Bohm and Friston: active information
{:.no_toc}

- Electrons are guided by 'active information' and change its state accordingly.
- activity of information
- "Activity" has been only eligible to physical entities, Bohm says that information acts too.
- A boat is guided by 'information' from the radar.
- Meaning is always implicated in language. Meaning is implicate.
- Implication is inference in logical sense.

### Generative order and inner communication
{:.no_toc}

- Bohm proposes generative order as an opposition to causality.
- Generative order does not ask 'why'.
- Unfortunate events are not the reason for misery, it's the habit of our mind rewinding it.
- Viral infection is a generative order because it makes diseases without being one.
- All growth are generative order, rather than causality.
- Thoughts are constantly 'generated' by consciousness.
- Anger is generated. It's not 'caused' by the event you might blame it on.
- **Mental fitness is emotional immunity.**
- Mental fitness is working on the generative order.
- Working on the generative orders is more effective way to make a change.
- Rheomode focuses on the verb in communication. Rheo- means flow in greek.

## 7. Inner communication and meditation

### All communication happens inside
{:.no_toc}

- "In" as in inner communication means the field of implicate order.
  
- Inner communication is an act of speech to oneself.
  
- Speech act is an act of change-making.
  
- Inner communication is not mere notification. It's changing one's mindscape.
  
- Human brain listens what it's going to say before it does.
  
- Interpersonal communication is really just two inner communications interacting.
  
- Language itself is a generative order.
  
- **We use language in our heads. It means our mind is social from the first place.**
  
- Inner communication is not that "inside" anyway.
  
- Self-image corresponds with the image of the caregiver.
  
- Conflict doesn't exist between people. It's locked in individuals.
  
- To overcome conflict, one must change the habit of negative inner communication.
  
- Inner communication emphasises controlling self-talk.
  
- Your thoughts are not yours. Neither your emotions are. Those are not what you are.
  
- **Core practice of inner communication is detachment from your thoughts and emotions.**
  
- Usually, storytellings have an 'attribution style'. It says what happened because who/what.
  
- A habit of positive storytelling strengthens mPFC and soothes amygdala.
  
- Negative storytelling about others comes back to you.
  
- Respect for others is self-respect.
  

### Power of inner communication
{:.no_toc}

- Inner communication is the terminal of all communications.
- It's not a joke that placebo is the best medicine out there.
- Believing in improvement, believing in one's own capability has strong power.
- At the moment of emptiness, we can take any storytelling in.
- Mental training is to notice mental commentary inside.
- Negative mental commentary makes you obsessed with unimportant things.
- Non-sense shakes existing generative order and empty the self.

### Meditation as mental training
{:.no_toc}

1. Sense meditation: tranquility
2. Movement meditation: tranquility
3. Consciousness meditation: transcendence

- Meditation is a scientifically valid method of training.
- Meditation can happen in any communication.
- Mental training is to create self-generative order.
- Self-consciousness enfolds and create freedom.
- First-timers should focus on soothing amygdala.
- It's difficult say that meditation is related to certain religion.
- A banal word can be a tool of transcendence.
- Unethical behaviour can activate amygdala.
- Francisco Varela proposed self-organisation, enactive perception, and so on.
- Compared to America and Europe, meditation is misunderstood in Korea.

## 8. Inner communication meditation for soothing amygdala

### Anger is fear
{:.no_toc}

- Under a threat, the product of our nervous system is interpreted as emotions.
- 'Emotion' is for negative experience.
- 'Emotion' is negative concept.
- "Positive emotion" is more of a thought than an emotion.
- "Positive emotion" belongs to the mind more than the body.
- Negative emotions are based on the body.
- emotion = negative emotion = fear
- There's no specific neural network that corresponds one of our "emotions".
- Resilience comes from the lack of fear of failure.
- "I feel and move. Therefore I exist."

### Emotion is in the body, not the mind
{:.no_toc}

- Allostasis: stability through change
- Allostasis implies that life must be an active 'prediction', not a passive feedback.
- Homeostasis cannot explain metamorphosis.
- Allostasis is more operational and time-aware.
- Mental illness comes from wrong predictive control.
- Consciousness takes prediction error as a discomfort so it will be taken care of.
- Emotions are how we recreate the world, not a mere reaction.
- Anxiety disorder makes you interpret generic noise a discomfort.
- Such discomfort may end up creating a feedback loop.
- Pain emerges from sense-making, between the body and the environment.

### Escape from emotional disorder and chronic pain
{:.no_toc}

- Sati meditation is a well-known attention reallocation training.
- Doing something you believe to remove pain actually does so.
- Soothing amygdala cannot be done directly, because the limbic system is subconscious.
- **Relaxing body soothes amygdala. It's the only way to control your emotions.**
- Breathing is the only part of autonomous system that you can control.
- One deep breath soothes your amygdala immediately.

### Relaxation training for amygdala
{:.no_toc}

- There are many types of meditation: walking, running, swimming, etc.
- Finding a right posture itself is listening to the body.
- Head, neck, jaws, and some other parts are directly connected to your brain.

- Thoughts are 'inner movement'.
- Brain does 'premotor act' before a movement. That's what thought is.

## 10. Inner communication meditation for activating mPFC

### Awareness and self-referential process
{:.no_toc}

- Two activities can activate mPFC: self-reference and positive information about self/others.
- Awareness means to see your thoughts, feelings, and conditions. It's a powerful self reference.
- Remembering past or imagining future is not self referential. Here and now is.

- Experience the experiences.

### Self-reference training and the result of meditation
{:.no_toc}

  - control of the body
  - communication
  - control of emotion
  - control of anxiety
  - reaction flexibility
  - insight
  - sensibility
  - morality
  - intuition
- All nine functions can be developed by meditation.

### Three steps of self-reference
{:.no_toc}

- "Decentering" makes you look yourself objectively. It's important in meditation.
- **It's to focus on the gap between the perception and reaction.**

- Third-person reference for yourself can help you cope with emotions.
- Explaining current situation to yourself can be a meaningful mind training.
- Notice your current emotion and label them.
- Notice that there is a storyteller between the stimulation and your reaction.
- That's the self-reference where you look back yourself.
- decentering = observing self = self-as-witness

- To face inside here and now, you need to train non-focus.
- Anxious people have higher activity in mPFC and amygdala when doing nothing.
- Mind-wandering brings up negative emotions.
- CEN focuses on tasks. Default Mode Network lets you be creative.
- Creativity happens between focus and wandering.
- Creative ideas come from free time, daydreaming, memories, connecting to your inner self.
- Multi-tasking uses CEN. It activates amygdala. Mind wandering is not multi-tasking.
- Regardless to CEN or DMN, point is to be here and now.
- Obsession of consciousness suppresses it.
- See the gap between inhale and exhale.
- Consciousness is always the subject. You cannot 'feel' consciousness.
- Silence is the premise of all sounds. Sounds cannot affect silence.
- No object can destroy the space.
- All silence is one. There's no difference between your silence and mine.
- The moment between inhale and exhale expands infinitely like an eternity.

# The Power of Now

I tried to rephrase or copy the parts of the book I have highlighted. It helps but I should change how I read books. Every chapter gives me profound inspiration. Every chapter is worth a dedicated post or something alike.

Here are action items.

- Embrace what She is. Full acceptance does the most change.

### End the Delusion of Time
{:.no_toc}

{:.no_toc}

- Someone close to you may cause trouble. This is irrelevant.

### Wherever You Are, Be There Totally
{:.no_toc}

- If there's nothing you can do for the Now, simply accept it and drop the resistance, so the miserable, resentful, or sorry feeling can't survive.
- Is there something you should be doing? Don't hesitate.
- Stress is wanting 'there' while being 'here'.

### The Inner Purpose of Your Life's Journey
{:.no_toc}

## 5. The State of Presence

{:.no_toc}

## 6. The Inner Body

### Finding Your Invisible and Indestructible Reality
{:.no_toc}

{:.no_toc}

- Use your mind purposefully, in conjunction with your inner body.

> If you need to use your mind for a specific purpose, use it in conjunction with your inner body. Only if you are able to be conscious without thought can you use your mind creatively, and the easiest way to enter that state is through your body. Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, stop thinking for a moment by focusing attention on your inner energy field. Become aware of the stillness. When you resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative. In any thought activity, make it a habit to go back and forth every few minutes or so between thinking and an inner kind of listening, an inner stillness. We could say: don't just think with your head, think with your whole body.

### The End of Your Life Drama

- Ego resists the end of its drama. It fears its own awakening.

### Impermanence and the Cycles of Life

> "I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind."

- You don't need the world, let alone the need for it to be different.
- You make a better world by being free from it.
- Unconsciousness is the source of Evil. Eliminate the cause, not the effect.

- Full attention is full acceptance, is surrender.

### The Power to Choose
{:.no_toc}

- The mind likes the known and hates the unknown.
- The present is always new. That's why the mind tries to ignore the Now.

> If you are one of the many people who have an issue with their parents, if you still harbor resentment about something they did or did not do, then you still believe that they had a choice — that they could have acted differently. It always looks as if people had choice, but that is an illusion.
