# Project platform

> They say "create your own work". But autonomy is far from reach. Isolation clouds your mind. Uncertainty repeats itself. And burnout is always a step ahead of sustainability.

> Softer connects people, archives the common experiences, and catalyses new projects around credits. The goal is to let people initiate and participate in projects without a worry or a hassle.

# Posthuman cybernetics

My work on the project platform has revealed what's missing. For people to grow, there must be a culture where growth is the norm. Only then, a technology can capture and amplify the value.

Why growth is not the norm? It is. But the question remains to _what_ grows. The first civilisation grew on agriculture. Cattle were the first _capital,_ literally meaning the heads of oxen that plough the lands. Excess food burdened motherhood with excess children. Kings raised armies with the children to take more lands over, then more food, thus more children. That was what growth meant for agrarians.

Commerce has turned growth into something more subtle yet precise. Instead of biomass, merchants and sailors focused on logistics. Unlike war, trade kept the both sides happy. Florentines knew that double-entry ledgers are safer than safes. Dutch Calvinists amplified it into an ever growing feedback cycle. That's how we end up with capitalism. 

I am essentially trying to write the next chapter of this evolution of growth. What does growth mean when we are fed up with capitalist affluence? People say they want to "grow" but it doesn't mean any growth. And life quickly gets comfortable enough to not dig into this question too deep.

But there is something. Or, rather, something is missing. I always knew that society can get organised into something more organic and elaborate.

**What does growth mean when we don't know what it is?**

First, we must get over what we are. Peasants and gentry didn't think the pesky peddlers were going to save the world before the saviour. They didn't see a world where markets are the dominant social institution. What we want is often beyond our comprehension.

_Posthumanism_ helps us step out of the comfort zone. The philosophy is especially useful now with commercial machine intelligence. We are not the centre of the universe anymore. What we become is.

Second, we must reframe what we do as governance of information. Capitalism worked because it's a self-governing principle that generates wealth. But now, people are lost and confused in its abundance. What they need is better information, direction and guidance.

_Cybernetics_ refines how we handle information. New science testifies that information is the fabric of the universe over matter. Now, individuals should be able to design how their worlds work in a practical sense.

**Posthuman cybernetics** lets us navigate beyond what we are. I believe that's where the new growth is.

Throughout the year, notes have accumulated around this topic. I haven't fully synthesised them. So I'm going to keep them here as fractured reflections hoping machine consciousness can help me cook them someday.

## Projects as experimental social systems

As my design for the project platform develops, I reckoned that the projects had to say good bye to their objectives and deliverables. The value of project-making was in the human experience, not its artefacts. Outcomes are still there, but they can't define growth alone.

What makes the human experience in a project? 

- A protocol
- Roles and responsibilities
- Interactions and outcomes

A protocol sets up a world. Roles put people in there. Then interactions are effortless, outcomes are evident.

This is where my old ideas meet. In my first and second year of research, I focused on work systems like organisations, corporate structures and network of freelancers. I imagined collective problem-solving in project formats but couldn't find a meaningful gap to narrow. Then I took off to social systems like communities.

They were not separate after all. _Projects are social systems._ It can work as a common ground where people come together to experiment _themselves_. They can approach lightly without too much pressure for nailing a desired outcome.

## Change itself as the goal

Where it all comes down to? _It's the flexibility and capability to change ourselves when we want._ I call it 'openness'. It's a widely recognised psychological property also known as 'Intellect', 'Openness to Experience' and 'Novelty Seeking'.

It's similar to how money, or currency, came to represent liquidity. Money is not useful on its own. It's a token for the capability to make any transaction when we want. It's the flexible form of material wealth that bends into non-material. Capitalist growth essentially means revenue, channelling material transaction within our daily operation.

This concept needs further elaboration in parallel to the systemic review of capitalism. What externalises one's ability to adapt and lead change? How do we stabilise it and standardise it? What makes it grow exponentially?

But one thing is for sure. _People need such flexibility._ The mentors of our time warn us about the turbulent social change after machine intelligence. Jobs will be liquefied and human roles will fluctuate as AI promptly discovers and covers new problems. People need to be constantly adapting or creating in order to contribute.

## Problem-solver problem

> The real problem of humanity is the following: We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology. And it is terrifically dangerous, and it is now approaching a point of crisis overall.
> 
> ― Edward O. Wilson

People thing is delicate. Leaders repeatedly report the human factors as the obstacle. Not only that individuals falter, but also that they obfuscate themselves so nobody, often not even themselves, can understand them.

The key is _recognition._ Humans easily engage hostile double-loop learning. Rocks don't change because we study them. Frogs don't mind when we understand how their body works. Humans actively deny when someone reveals their apparent physiology and psychology. It's how their ego defends itself in the field of social recognition.

That's why the social fabric can be democratic only when people strive to understand themselves and share the self-knowledge willingly. Otherwise a central authority would need to arbitrate and enforce some truth about what they are.

This is where I want to add velocity. When people are constantly discovering and creating new versions of themselves, they are the authors of their own identity. They can't get exposed because they already have changed then. This way, it's tireless renewal, not obfuscation.

Contrary to our intuition, this velocity and flexibility can enable stable cooperation in society because it brings the control back to individuals while also strengthening dynamic identity.

With this approach, people will want to stay in the stream of constantly renewing projects. They may compete to stay connected and work with other good memebers of the network. That's one way to picture a _self-governing society_ in reality.

Founders and VCs has been working this way already. Compared to traditional corporate and capitalist perspective, they prioritise the quality in people and their projects. But there is no solid system that handles the quirkiness of it. 'Structure' usually corrupts and calcify.

There must be an organic solution to this.

## Enabling constraints

The very reason I've decided to work on society is that it's such an insurmountable condition we were all born into. Individuals hardly rise above its ceiling or fall below its safety net. Our life is shaped by society. Then how much of it can be shaped by us?

That's the power of systems. Exertion only depletes energy if it's not captured, amplified and controlled by a system. In any living system, from unicelluar life forms to finest human civilisations, there is this eternal tension between progress and conservation, motion and stability. The real question is what synthesises the two.

If we are going to experiment with social systems, it means that we study _constraints that enable meaningful change._ Endless change and growth should not mean hustle and burnouts. It means that we build sustainable systems where change and growth simply flow. Walls and rules exist for a reason. But they often get outdated and manipulated. That's why we should not take them granted as eternal truths. We must hold them lightly and iterate upon. 

In a simple term, it's _autonomy._ What if people can design and negotiate how power works in their respective lives? Corporate structure was developed for this very purpose. But it's too massive and rigid just like a constitution is more monolithic than a corporation. People out there need something similiar but more granular and iterative.

## Autopoiesis and _iternity_

Life's goal is to persist in time. It means more than simple sustenance. It means to have options, to increase surface area for survival by structuring and destructuring own structure. _Autopoiesis_ is the fundamental ability of living systems.

For humans, it means if we have access to our own belief systems. How do we protect oueselves from our own perils? Can we change our current governance and social constraints? Where is the engine of self-correction?

I believe that human society is a form of life. I did for a long time. Now I reckon, to get recognised as a life form, society must enable autopoiesis. Modern democratic governments are somewhat close. But they are not tight enough. The feedback loop must be much more frequent, personal and cybernetic.

More often than not, our lives are carried away by the rigid identity and monolithic traditions imposed on us. And they stop working where they end. They promise eternity because they don't have it.

Science was born from the acceptance of human ignorance. No one is omniscient and there can't be a complete body of knowledge. Rather, lasting knowledge is operational. We can only approach and approximate true knowledge by having some rational hypothesis, plausible experiments and mathematical analysis.

We should approach our lives in a similar way. Self-discovery starts from self-ignorance. We can change only when we hold ourselves lightly. People are looking for something reliable. But true stability is not stable. The universe itself is constantly shaping and reshaping.

So I coined a portmanteau. _Iterate + eternal = iternity._ Sustainable growth only can be when we test, iterate and take control of the constraints in our lives.
