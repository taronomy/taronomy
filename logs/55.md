# Project platform

> They say "create your own work". But autonomy is far from reach. Isolation clouds your mind. Uncertainty repeats itself. And burnout is always a step ahead of sustainability.

# Posthuman cybernetics

My work on the project platform has revealed what's missing. For people to grow, there must be a culture where growth is the norm. Only then, a technology can capture and amplify the value.

Why growth is not the norm? It is. But the question remains to _what_ grows. The first civilisation grew on agriculture. Cattle were the first _capital,_ literally meaning the heads of oxen that plough the lands. Excess food burdened motherhood with excess children. Kings raised armies with the children to take more lands over, then more food, thus more children. That was what growth meant for agrarians.

Modernisation turned growth into something more subtle yet precise. Instead of biomass, merchants and sailors focused on logistics. Unlike war, trade kept the both sides happy. Florentines knew that double-entry ledgers are safer than safes. Dutch Calvinists amplified it into an ever growing feedback cycle. That's how we end up with capitalism. 

I am essentially trying to write the next chapter of this evolution of growth. What does growth mean when we are fed up with capitalist affluence? People say they want to "grow" but it doesn't mean any growth. And life quickly gets comfortable enough to not dig into this question too deep.

But there is something. Or, rather, something is missing. I always knew that society can get organised into something more organic an elaborate.

_What does growth mean when we don't know what it is?_

Throughout the year, I've had inspirations and epiphanies trying to answer this question. I haven't fully synthesised them. So I'm going to keep them here as fractured reflections so machine consciousness can hopefully help me cook them in the future.

## Projects as temporal social systems

As my design for the project platform develops, I reckoned that the projects had to say good bye to their objectives and deliverables. The value of project-making was in the human experience, not the side effects. Outcomes are still there, but they can't define growth alone.

What makes the human experience in a project? 

- A protocol
- Roles and responsibilities
- Interactions and outcomes

A protocol sets up a world. Roles put people in there. Then interactions are effortless, outcomes are evident.

This is where my old ideas meet. In my first and second year of research, I focused on work systems like organisations, corporate structures and network of freelancers. I imagined collective problem-solving in project formats but couldn't find a meaningful gap to narrow. Then I took off to social systems like communities.

They were not separate after all. _Projects themselves are social systems._ It can work as a common ground where people come together if they can approach lightly, without too much pressure for nailing a desired outcome.

## Change itself as the goal

Where it all comes down to? _It's the flexibility and capability to change ourselves when we want._ I call it **openness**. It's a widely recognised psychological property also known as "Intellect", "Openness to Experience" and "Novelty Seeking".

It's similar to how money, or currency, came to represent liquidity. Money is not useful on its own. It's a token for the capability to make any transaction when we want. It's the flexible form of material wealth that bends into non-material. Capitalist growth essentially means revenue, channelling material transaction within our daily operation.

This concept needs further elaboration in parallel to the systemic review of capitalism. What externalises one's ability to adapt and lead change? How do we stabilise it and standardise it? What makes it grow exponentially?

But one thing is for sure. _People need such flexibility._ The mentors of our time warn us about the turbulent social change after machine intelligence. Jobs will be liquefied and human roles will fluctuate as AI promptly discovers and covers new problems. People need to be constantly adapting or creating in order to contribute.

## When problem-solvers are the problem

> The real problem of humanity is the following: We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology. And it is terrifically dangerous, and it is now approaching a point of crisis overall.

People thing is delicate. Leaders repeatedly address the human factors as the obstacle. Not only that individuals falter, but also that they obfuscate themselves so nobody, often not even themselves, can understand them.

The key is _recognition._ Humans easily engage hostile double-loop learning. Rocks don't change because we study them. Frogs don't mind when we understand how their body works. Humans actively deny when someone reveals their apparent physiology and psychology. It's how their ego defends itself in the field of social recognition.

That's why the social fabric can't be democratic unless people stride to understand themselves and share the self-knowledge willingly. Otherwise a central authority would need to arbitrate and enforce some truth about what they are.

This is where I want to add velocity. When people are constantly discovering and creating new versions of themselves, they are the author of their own identity. They can't get "revealed" because they already have changed then. This way, it's tireless renewal, not obfuscation.

Contrary to our intuition, this velocity and flexibility can enable stable cooperation in society because it brings the control back to individuals while also strengthening dynamic identity.

With this approach, people will want to stay in the stream of constantly renewing projects. They may compete to stay connected and work with other good memebers of the network. That's one way to picture a _self-governing society_ in reality.

Founders and VCs has been working this way already. Compared to traditional corporate and capitalist perspective, they prioritise the quality in people an their projects. But there was no solid system to handle the quirkiness of it. 'Structure' usually corrupts and calcify.

There must be an organic solution to this.
