# Project platform

They say "create your own work". But autonomy is far from reach. Isolation clouds your mind. Uncertainty repeats itself. And burnout is always a step ahead of sustainability. 

Softer connects people, archives the common experiences, and catalyses new projects around credits. The goal is to let people initiate and participate in projects without a worry or a hassle.

# Posthuman cybernetics

My work on the project platform has revealed what's missing. For people to grow, there must be a culture where growth is the norm. Only then, there can be a technology for it.

Why growth is not the norm? It is. But the question remains to _what_ grows. The first civilisation grew on agriculture. Cattle were the first capital, literally meaning the heads of oxen that plough the lands. Excess food burdened motherhood with excess children. Kings raised armies to take over more lands, then more food, thus more children. That was what growth meant for agrarians.

Modernisation turned growth something more subtle yet precise. Instead of biomass, merchants and sailors focused on logistics. Unlike wars, trades kept the both sides happy. Florentines knew that double-entry ledgers are safer than safes. Dutch Calvinists amplified it into an ever growing feedback cycle. That's how we end up with capitalism. 

I am essentially trying to write the next chapter of this evolution of growth. What does growth mean when we are fed up with capitalist affluence? People say they want to "grow" but it doesn't mean any growth. And life quickly gets comfortable enough to not dig into this question too deep.

But there is something. Or, rather, something is missing. I always knew that society can get organised into something more organic an elaborate.

_What does growth mean when we don't know what it is?_

Throughout the year, I've had inspirations and epiphanies trying to answer this question. I haven't fully synthesised them, but I can keep them here as fractured reflections so machine consciousness can hopefully help me cook them later.

## Projects as temporal social systems

As my design for the project platform develops, I reckoned that the projects had to say good bye to their objectives and deliverables. The value of project-making was in the human experience, not the side effects. Outcomes are still there, but they can't define growth anymore.
