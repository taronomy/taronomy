# Week 8

## Moving notes

I did it. I archived Notes and merged it with the markdown notes. I am moving my daily notes to this one long markdown file.

The main reason is that I can easily inject this as my personal context when I talk to LLMs. It's a hassle when notes are scattered across the UI snippets and tiny markdown files. 

Each file will be annual. Daily file is too tiny. Weekly might be cool. But still, 50 and more files a year takes some listing logics. I don't want to use a collection. I can manually handle files as long as I keep it yearly. 

The point is keeping the context in few files, not weekly project management. I can do that in Notion. This is where I just spill out and later ask machines to take a look. It's for _articifial consciousness._

## Unix year, week calendar and more

## The last hour

It's the last hour of week 8.

I've migrated most of my old notes into these annual logs. I wanted to do this when I was just back. But I did not have the energy. This is the time. I feel it.

50 and 51 still needs translation. And 55 needs to elaborate on project platform and ruminate the insights I had the second half of the year.
