# Week 8

## Moving notes

I did it. I archived Notes and merged it with the markdown notes. I am moving my daily notes to this one long markdown file.

The main reason is that I can easily inject this as my personal context when I talk to LLMs. It's a hassle when notes are scattered across the UI snippets and tiny markdown files. 

Each file will be annual. Daily file is too tiny. Weekly might be cool. But still, 50 and more files a year takes some listing logics. I don't want to use a collection. I can manually handle files as long as I keep it yearly. 

The point is keeping the context in fewer files, not weekly project management. I can do that in Notion. This is where I just spill out and later ask machines to take a look. It's for _articificial consciousness._

## Unix year

I'm using Unix year I've been thinking for a long time. 1970 is the epoch, but it's the year _zero,_ not year one. This is the mathematically correct way. This year is 2026 CE, which is Unix year 56. Reasons are:

- CE comes from a particular religion
- Could keep it neutral and technical
- Unix provides a good epoch
- 2 digits are better than 4
- Conversion is trivial

It's my personal convention. So I'm prioritising my preference over compatibility. This is possible because I decided to make this place my own.

### Week calendar

Follows the week calendar. There is already a widely accepted ISO standard for it. I prefer weeks over months because:

- Months are agricultural and maritime reflecting seasons
- 30 days are not granular enough for project cadence
- Society already works based on the 7-day cadence
- There is a well established custom for it

Week numbers are going to be the level 1 headings.

### Alphabetic days?

How about this:

1. A: Monday
2. B: Tuesday
3. C: Wednesday
4. D: Thursday
5. E: Friday
6. F: Saturday
7. G: Sunday

F might be confusing. It's just an idea.

### And 24-hour time

I always preferred 16:30 over 4:30 PM

Putting it all together. It's u56w09e22:28 now.

## The last hour

It's the last hour of week 8.

I've migrated most of my old notes into these annual logs. I wanted to do this when I was just back. But I did not have the energy. This is the time. I feel it.

# Week 9

I translated the original texts and fixed grammar. Apparently, I spill a lot of typo. Now translated into English, I want to give my past works a good read someday.

I had to cut out good chunks of bullet lists. They don't really make sense once time has passed. And it's difficult to pull off prose later.

I should write down proses when I have an idea. That's the only way they survive time. I should process each log annually as well. 

Each year:

- Summarise yearly activity on top
- Scan body for typos and errors
- Update navigation

## The objective

My vision is not my solutions. I have been confusing myself with the two. Vision creates problems. Or, rather, problems are different perpectives observing the same vision. It's how we _feel_ the vision not being the reality. Only then, there can be solutions that approach the problems.

Instead, I've been putting up my vision as potential solutions. Anyone, even myself, would have been confused by such transposition.

### Vision

My vision is **society as a form of life.** I always saw society as a living entity in its infancy. I could depict what it looks like in its maturity. But that would be not much more than a science fiction. People speculated what progress would look like. Progress surely happened but in ways people never expected. World is affluent now, but affluence looks different across the globe. I can't predict the future precisely. But I know that cybernetic humanity is possible. We have everything we need to build organic social systems.

### Problem

Then what's the real problem people experience when society hasn't fulfilled its potentials? It's **sustainable growth.** In other words, it's the eternal tension between _flexibility and stability._ Motion and structure compete. Life has been evolving through the systems that consolidate the two. People want change, but worry something might break.

And there's also the alignment challenge between the system—society and subsystems—consciousness. Inside, people feel that something is missing in their life. It's because they don't see things to synthesise in their minds, and higher consciousness remains dormant when there's nothing to connect. They would talk about 'lack of motivation'. So they need something in their lives to synthesise.

But also, they worry their society might not pay off their pursuits calling them 'hobbies'. Consciousness is costly inside and hobbies are costly outside. If there's no growing feedback cycles or a generative order, their energy simply scatters into the gaping void of night sky when they talk about the 'stupid things' they tried.

### Solution

And **plays** are the solution I'm holding in my hand. What do plays really enable? Most importantly, it tests many different social systems across time. The value is in the _information such iterations generate._ 

Currently, social interaction relies on either tradition or contingency. One is stable in long-term but monolithic, the other is generative but chaotic.

Plays are creative but also structured. Participants can experience and make decisions. And their scripts aligns the mind and the world by drawing a clear line between them. Distinction makes distance, but also clarifies that the plays are the artificial bridge. This way, people are not anxious anymore from the cognitive dissonance. Mind can't be the world, vice versa. But they certainly can be bridged. **That's how plays consolidate flexibility and stability of social interactions.** Plays can shape reality _because_ they are ephemeral and illusory
