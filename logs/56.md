# Week 8

## Moving notes

I did it. I archived Notes and merged it with the markdown notes. I am moving my daily notes to this one long markdown file.

The main reason is that I can easily inject this as my personal context when I talk to LLMs. It's a hassle when notes are scattered across the UI snippets and tiny markdown files. 

Each file will be annual. Daily file is too tiny. Weekly might be cool. But still, 50 and more files a year takes some listing logics. I don't want to use a collection. I can manually handle files as long as I keep it yearly. 

The point is keeping the context in fewer files, not weekly project management. I can do that in Notion. This is where I just spill out and later ask machines to take a look. It's for _articificial consciousness._

## Unix year

I'm using Unix year I've been thinking for a long time. 1970 is the epoch, but it's the year _zero,_ not year one. This is the mathematically correct way. This year is 2026 CE, which is Unix year 56. Reasons are:

- CE comes from a particular religion
- Could keep it neutral and technical
- Unix provides a good epoch
- 2 digits are better than 4
- Conversion is trivial

It's my personal convention. So I'm prioritising my preference over compatibility. This is possible because I decided to make this place my own.

### Week calendar

Follows the week calendar. There is already a widely accepted ISO standard for it. I prefer weeks over months because:

- Months are agricultural and maritime reflecting seasons
- 30 days are not granular enough for project cadence
- Society already works based on the 7-day cadence
- There is a well established custom for it

Week numbers are going to be the level 1 headings.

### Alphabet days of the week?

How about this:

1. A: Monday
2. B: Tuesday
3. C: Wednesday
4. D: Thursday
5. E: Friday
6. F: Saturday
7. G: Sunday

F might be confusing. It's just an idea.

### And 24-hour time

I always preferred 1630 over 4:30 PM

Putting it all together. It's u56w09e2228 now.

## The last hour

It's the last hour of week 8.

I've migrated most of my old notes into these annual logs. I wanted to do this when I was just back. But I did not have the energy. This is the time. I feel it.

# Week 9

I translated the original texts and fixed grammar. Apparently, I spill a lot of typo. Now translated into English, I want to give my past works a good read someday.

I had to cut out good chunks of bullet lists. They don't really make sense once time has passed. And it's difficult to pull off prose later.

I should write down proses when I have an idea. That's the only way they survive time. I should process each log annually as well. 

Each year:

- Summarise yearly activity on top
- Scan body for typos and errors
- Update navigation
